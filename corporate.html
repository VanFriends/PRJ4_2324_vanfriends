				   <li>&nbsp;</li>
              </ul>
				
            <h2>Font choices</h2> 
		    <li>The fonts that the team choose for the website are Forma DJR Deck, Interstate, and Acumin Pro. The team use these fonts to give the vibe of minimalistic and modern on our website. Since our target audiences are people from 23 until 33 years old, and they tend to like something simple and modern. During our interviews, the interviewees also told us that they imagine a website where everything is visible and easy to see. Because of that we choose geometrical type of fonts to give simplicity and make our messages easier to understand.  </li>
            <h2>User interface patterns</h2>
            <li>We incorporated various UI patterns in order to elevate the user experiene by making the information more accesible and the design more alligned with our target audience. We used a responsive navbar that leads the user quickly throughout the whole site that is available even when you scroll down to the end of a page. We used the bootstrap grids and margins in order to systemize the information and help the flow of reading. We added carrousel in order to present the text in a more interesting way and keep the interest of the user, as our website is higlhy informative and plain text can get boring. We used cards in order to combine text and pictures in a neat and organized way, so again the information is more systemized. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
<h2>The structure of the navigation and content</h2>
            <li>We based the structure of the navigation and content of our website on the UX principles and hierarchy of information, so that the user experience can be as best as possible. We applied information architecture, placing the most important content at the top of the page. For text, we followed the heading-subheading-paragraph structure in order to further highlight the most important parts. </li>
			  
            <h2>Relation to other units:</h2>

              <ul>
                <li><em>&nbsp; - How does website design fit the <strong>values and personality of the brand</strong>?</em></li>
                <li>The design that the team has chosen is a simplistic but enough information. With this way of designing a website, the team could easily meet the expectations of the target audience. Our values are about community, nature, involvement, and evolvement, which we have put some nature elements on the website such as the color of the website that represents nature color. The team add some community feature on the website as well such as sharing stories that camper van friends have. To make it fit with our value involvement, the team has decided to add a feature of reviewing which camper van friends can review the routes that they have been explored also giving review about the facilities that they need, with this feature we give them the freedom to share and obtain extra knowledge for themselves. &nbsp;</li>
                <li><em>&nbsp; - How does website design fit the <strong>marketing and communication strategy</strong>?</em></li>
                <li>Our marketing and communication strategy, we want to give our target audience a platform where they can feel connected and related with. The design of our website fits perfectly the target audience’s wants but also our wants. The design that fits for our marketing and communication strategy such as using the color of nature and represent of the beauty of nature. With this we can connect our product to our target audience even more &nbsp;</li>
                <li><em>   &nbsp;- How does website design help showcase the <strong>unique value proposal of the product</strong>?</em></li>
                <li> Our unique value proposal is Nomadic Hub which we will connect our fellow van travelers, also giving them opportunities to follow and try new routes to explore. This unique value we implement in our website design, which we give the function of finding new routes or the routes that the travelers did not know before. We add a map page that travelers can open to find the routes that they can explore, besides of that the travelers can also share their ideas, trips, and tricks to other users using the feature of review.</li>

    <h2>Goal:</h2>
    <p>The goal of our testing is to know if our platform is user-friendly and if our target audiences have some difficulties during the testing so that we can improve our platform.</p>

    <h2>Participant #1 - Lotte Dekker, 24 years old:</h2>
    <p>Lotte is one of the camper van users in the Netherlands. She met our target audience because she traveled to European countries with her camper van and has experience in DIY.</p>
    <p>For this participant, we have invited her to come to our campus and do the testing on campus. The material for this testing is the website itself, a laptop, and a phone to record.</p>
    <p>The instructions for this participant are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1. Find the destinations.</li>
        <li>2. Find a toilet in Lake Como.</li>
        <li>3. Find a gas station in Lake Como.</li>
        <li>4. Find meet the team.</li>
        <li>5. Write a review.</li>
        <li>6. Find a review.</li>
        <li>7. Sign up with your email.</li>
        <li>8. Open Instagram/Facebook.</li>
        <li>&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <p>At the end of the testing, we asked these three questions to know what opinions the participant had about our platform:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1. Is the website the right portrayal of our concept?</li>
        <li>2. How can we improve the website?</li>
        <li>3. What do you like about our website?</li>
        <li>&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <p>From the testing with this participant, the teams know that the color scheme of the website gives the idea of the target audience and what our platform is about. The participants also found it interactive and easy to navigate through the website. The points of improvement for this participants are we can maybe make it more clearer how to sign up to the website or platform also it is maybe a good idea to have a small table of contents on the page of the map.</p>

    <h2>Participant #2 - Bianca Moldovan, 30 years old:</h2>
    <p>Bianca is one of the camper van users from Romanian which is currently staying in the Netherlands. She met our target audience because of her experience in camper van traveling. She is currently staying in the Netherlands for her camper van journey and we met her on Instagram and ask if she could help us to do this testing interview on location which on campus of Breda University of Applied Sciences. The experiences that she has on camper van traveling are enough to become on of our participants and ask if our website or app can meet the expectations of the camper van users.</p>

    <p>From this testing, our participant likes the way the website is easy to use and with easy instructions, and the map uses a simplistic design making our participant easily understand the instructions but also, she find enough information. The points that she brought up for the improvements are a search bar feature when the website has a lot of destinations, adding a special forum page so that the users can easily talk to each other, and the sign-up feature is visible but not very clear if it is for signing up to the platform or just subscribing to some information.</p>
				  <h2>Participant #3 - Fabian Vos, 26 years old:</h2>
<p>Fabian is a camper van user from the Netherlands. He started his camper van journey when he traveled in a camper van together with his parents when he was 19 years old. Since then, he falls in love with traveling with a camper van.</p>
<p>For this participant, we have invited him to come to our campus and do the testing on location. The materials that we used during the interview were a laptop to open the website and test it, and a phone to record the testing.</p>
<p>The instructions for this participant are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>1. Find the destinations.</li>
        <li>2. Find a toilet in Lake Como.</li>
        <li>3. Find a gas station in Lake Como.</li>
        <li>4. Find meet the team.</li>
        <li>5. Write a review.</li>
        <li>6. Find a review.</li>
        <li>7. Sign up with your email.</li>
        <li>8. Open Instagram/Facebook.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of the testing, we asked these three questions to know what opinions the participants had about our platform:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Is the website the right portrayal of our concept?</li>
    <li>How can we improve the website?</li>
    <li>What do you like about our website?</li>
</ul>
<p>From this testing, our participant advised us to put the explanation of the maps a bit more spread through the page instead of only on one side which in this case is on the left side, and maybe to make it more user-friendly we as a team could put a “back to top” button to make it easier for the users to go back to the beginning of the page. He likes the feature of the review on the map page because it makes more interactive for the users.</p>

<h2>Participant #4 - Ivan Petrov, 26 years old:</h2>
<p>Ivan Petrov is a camper van user from Bulgaria who stays here in the Netherlands for his study. He traveled a lot with his camper van before he started his study here in the Netherlands. Although he still travels with his camper van once a year. He fits our target audience for this interview because of his experiences traveling with a camper van also using an app for camper van travel.</p>
<p>For this participant, he invited us to come to his accommodation and do the testing interview there. The materials that we used during this testing are a phone for showing the website, and another phone to record the test.</p>
<p>The instructions for this participant are:</p>
<ul>
   <li>1. Find the destinations.</li>
        <li>2. Find a toilet in Lake Como.</li>
        <li>3. Find a gas station in Lake Como.</li>
        <li>4. Find meet the team.</li>
        <li>5. Write a review.</li>
        <li>6. Find a review.</li>
        <li>7. Sign up with your email.</li>
        <li>8. Open Instagram/Facebook.</li>
        <li>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of the testing, we asked these three questions to know what opinions the participants had about our platform:</p>
<ul>
    <li>1. Is the website the right portrayal of our concept?</li>
    <li>2. How can we improve the website?</li>
    <li>3. What do you like about our website?</li>
    <li>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>We can conclude from this interview testing, that he likes the section of the review on the destinations map, also the website is very well-made and simple. He also thinks that the website aligns with the concept of the brand and also shows the interesting feature of the community.</p>

          <!-- End Production, start Marketing -->

          <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
          <p>VanFriends is a brand for people who live a fulltime vanlife. We offer routes in multiple countries all over Europe. These routes include points where you can park for the night or day, where you can get gas, where you can get water, where you can find toilets, showers and more. For all these, you can read reviews and write your own reviews too. Later we plan to add a page where you can read tips and post tips yourself. In terms of promotion, our team held a campaign on both Instagram and Facebook, as based on our marketing and communication plan and its communication message and objectives.</p>
          <h2>Target Audience</h2>
		  <p>For our target group of Campervan users, we made two personas' as seen in the link <a href="https://edubuas-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/224996_buas_nl/Ec0lBCEdg4tEjOajzfpOLXQBUEJy0x0G-aFla5cxPall3A?e=Ll68Al" target="_blank">here</a>. We chose to make two personas as our target audience has an age ranging from 23 to 33 and they usually live very different lives as 23-year-olds could still be finishing up their studies or have just started working, whereas 33-year-olds have been working for multiple years.   

They use platforms like Instagram and Facebook when it comes to van life. They join groups and look for connections, inspiration and tips for van DIY's, how to travel mor sustainable and eco-friendly as well as where to go on their next trips. 

Furthermore, we focus on individuals who live in their van full-time, therefore we specify our target audience by stating they are remote workers. These individuals have thrown their life around by moving into a van rather than continuing to live in a house or apartment. A reason for them to do this is freedom for a big part, as mentioned in multiple of our problem interviews Interviews.  

An important detail is that we focus specifically on people who don't have children, but they can have pets with them or live with their partner. </p>
		 <h2>Communication Objectives</h2>

    <h3>Original Objectives</h3>

    <h4>Reach Objective</h4>
    <p>We want to reach an amount of 100 users on Instagram as well as 100 users on Facebook, within Europe, by the 30th of March.</p>

    <h4>Affect</h4>
    <p>We want our followers/our target audience to feel inspired and excited by our social media posts and with that we also want them to feel connected to what our brand stands for by the 30th of March 2024.</p>

    <h4>Response</h4>
    <p>We want our target audience to respond by following our social media accounts and to interact (leave comments/like the posts) with our posts on Instagram and Facebook. We want to reach a minimum of 50 engagements/interactions on our Instagram and 25 engagements/interactions on Facebook by the 30th of March 2024.</p>

    <h3>Changed Objectives</h3>

    <h4>Reach Objective</h4>
    <p>We want to reach an amount of 400 users on Instagram as well as 100 users on Facebook, within Europe, by the 1st of April.</p>

    <h4>Affect</h4>
    <p>We want our followers/our target audience to feel inspired and excited by our social media posts and with that we also want them to feel connected to what our brand stands for by the 1st of April 2024.</p>

    <h4>Response</h4>
    <p>We want our target audience to respond by following our social media accounts and to interact (leave comments/like the posts) with our posts on Instagram and Facebook. We want to reach a minimum of 50 engagements/interactions on our Instagram and 75 engagements/interactions on Facebook by the 1st of April 2024.</p>

    <p>We reached these changed objectives a few days prior to the date set for the objectives, therefore we were not able to change them anymore as a new goal would not be reached before the end of our marketing campaign.</p> 
		  
		   <h2>Media Tactics</h2>

    <p>We chose the platforms Instagram and Facebook as these platforms offer groups, for example Facebook groups, where people can join in and give tips, share their lives and form connections, which is something our target audience uses social media for. On Instagram this is not done through groups, but through their own accounts they can share their opinions, tips and tricks which can be responded to in the comments or through polls and questions stickers that are posted on Instagram stories.</p>

    <p>Next to that, Facebook's biggest Audience is similar in age to the larger part of our target audience's age category, as their largest age group ranges the age of 25 to 34 (Zote, 2024).</p>

    <p>The younger category in our target audience falls in the biggest age category for Instagram, as this is from the age of eighteen to the age of 24 (Zote, 2024) and our younger target audience falls into this with the ages of 23 and 24, as the rest is covered by Facebook. Though this is the same for Instagram and TikTok, we chose Instagram as according to Zote (2024), the monthly number of active users are 1,7 billion for TikTok with 36,2% in their largest audience group based on age, and 2 billion for Instagram with 30,8% in their largest audience group based on age. If you calculate that with the percentage of users that fall within their biggest audiences based on age, it results into more monthly active users within the ages of the biggest audience on Instagram as this results in 616 million monthly active users on Instagram and on TikTok this is 615,4 million monthly active users.</p>

    <p>Since our brand will share routes and other information and inspiration on its website as well as on its social media, these platforms seemed to be the best fitting for our brand and our target audience.</p>
		  
		  <h2>Planning</h2>

    <p>Our content calendar is as seen in the <a href="https://edubuas-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/224996_buas_nl/EdkIAXwt3IFKnM5_yNbf26QB5PLYfTX7pFGG3M-6f2a_sA?e=ydAsVu" target="_blank">link here</a>.</p>

    <p>For our content planning we decided to make a plan where we would post on a daily basis. This, however, did not end up happening for the first week of the project, as we managed to forget about our Facebook page and were still figuring out what our exact brand would be about with the problem and solution interviews. No one on the team had a lot of knowledge about this platform and how it operates either, which also made it more difficult to start it up.</p>

    <p>The timing of a post is also important. We came to the conclusion that the best posting times were slightly different on both platforms, as according to Geyser (2024a) (2024b), the overall better times to post daily were as follows:</p>

    <p>Monday: 5 AM, 11 AM, 12 PM, 1 PM<br>
    Tuesday: 7 AM, 8 AM, 9 AM, 10 AM<br>
    Wednesday: 5 AM, 6 AM, 9 AM, 10 AM, 11 AM<br>
    Thursday: 6 AM, 11 AM, 12 PM, 1 PM<br>
    Friday: 7 AM, 2 PM, 3 PM, 4 PM<br>
    Saturday: 6 AM, 8 AM, 9 AM, 10 AM<br>
    Sunday: 1 AM, 6 PM, 7 PM, 8 PM</p>

    <p>For Facebook this was different as there the better times to post are as follows:</p>

    <p>Monday: 9:00 AM, 11:00 AM, 3:00 PM<br>
    Tuesday: 9:00 AM, 11:00 AM, 3:00 PM<br>
    Wednesday: 9:00 AM, 10:00 AM, 1:00 PM, 4:00 PM<br>
    Thursday: 9:00 AM, 11:00 AM, 4:00 PM<br>
    Friday: 11:00 AM, 4:00 PM, 6:00 PM</p>

    <p>We further found that for Facebook the best times to post on the weekends differ per day. On Saturday it is at 8 a.m. or between 10 to 3 p.m. for Sunday it is between 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. However, we also found that for business to consumer the best times are between 9 and10 am, 12 am and 13 pm, 16 and 17 pm We therefore tried to adjust some of the posts to this, by placing them around 9 am, 10 am and 16 pm, as those times are also coherent with the regular best posting times.</p>

    <p>With this in mind, we planned for all posts to be placed at a time that is good for the specific day. On days where we post multiple posts, like on the first foodie Friday posts on Facebook, the day we posted our mission, vision and values on both Instagram and Facebook, we made sure to plan them one hour apart, within the hours that work.</p>
		      <p>For Instagram we found that Thursdays and Wednesdays were best for carousel posts. More specifically, Wednesdays would be the best to have a better reach and Thursdays would get more engagement. (Coosto, 2024) We further found that Tuesdays are the best for reels for both the most engagement and reach. (Coosto, 2024)</p>

    <p>For all our post we decided to make them resonate with what we want our product to be or become at a later stage if we were to continue it after this project. We also decided to focus on what we found our target audience uses Instagram and Facebook for which is to get tips and inspiration for their van and their trips.</p>

    <p>Therefore we decided to post mostly inspiration on multiple topics as is visible in our social media planning, future planning and our Instagram and Facebook. We did decide to combine this with funny or relatable reels and memes as they “can be an effective marketing tool they can quickly capture the attention of a large audience and generate engagement“ (SocialPilot, 2024).</p>

    <p>We also created an event on Facebook which we posted about on both Instagram and Facebook as this as an actual event could help us create brand awareness according to Decker (2022)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
<h2>Instagram (<a href="https://edubuas-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/220367_buas_nl/EUHhxBo3ewZCgnaeHR8neYgBOobdp3ellPdUhpC9GDME2Q?e=ZBxNEs" target="_blank">Analytics </a>)</h2>
    <p>We learned we can successfully reach accounts on Instagram to reach our reach objective. On Instagram we reached a total of 631 accounts and had a total of 3396 impressions, which means that we reached more than our reach objective, which was originally 100 followers, which was later changed to 400 after reaching more than 200 accounts and gaining over 100 followers.</p>
    
    <p>We further learned that reels are the biggest contributors to our reach as our reels have reached a total of 637 accounts, whereas our posts and stories together have not brought in half of that with a total of 322 accounts. This is also visible in our top content as our reel that introduces the team has had a reach of 324 accounts. This reel was posted on the 19th of March.</p>
	  <p>We learned that we can successfully reach our target audience. Our biggest age group is in the ages of 18 to 24 followed by 25 to 34, which means we were successful with reaching our target audience age wise on Instagram.</p>
    <p>The most active times of our followers when looking at days is Thursday so for future planning it is important to regularly post on Thursday, however the differences are small so the other days are still important too.</p>
    <p>In the period from the 10th of March to the 16th, we reached our reach objective of a hundred accounts before the 1st of April. Since we reached it at this time already we put it up to a reach of 300 accounts before the first of April.</p>
    <p>Though this reach objective was reached quickly after because in the period of 17th of March to the 23rd of March we reached 517 accounts and had an amount of 117 followers and 1723 impressions.</p>
    <p>In the period of the 24th of March to the 30th of March we reached another 157 accounts which brings us to a total reach of 631 accounts of which 146 accounts follow us and 485 accounts don’t follow us. The impressions overall are at an amount of 3396.</p>
    <p>We learned that getting engagement with our post is more difficult, however, we have reached our response objective for Instagram. The engagement that we achieved was a lot less, as shown below, we only reached a total of 84 accounts that engaged with us, of which 65 accounts are our followers and 19 accounts are non-followers. Most of the engagement was by reels and posts, the stories did not have as much engagement. This might be caused by the lack of call to action on our story as we only had two stories where we asked people to share their thoughts.</p>
    <p>We further learned that successful reels are the best for engagement, as our reel that had the biggest reach of all our posts also has the biggest engagement and has brought in 52 of the 74 engagements retrieved by reels. Therefore we further learned that reach and engagement go hand in hand.</p>
    <p>We learned that most of our interactions are in the form of likes, so for the future we would like to work on this by adding more call to action in the form of asking questions to get the reached accounts to leave comments as well.</p>
    <p>We learned that the same counts for our post interactions, so here we will need to work on adding more call to actions as well in the future.</p>
    <p>We learned that a successful reel and a slight change by adding a bit more call to action can go a long way in gaining more reach. The most growth was made around the 19th of March which is around the time we changed our content a bit in way so there is more call to action and more engagement with the Instagram user and a better connection to our brand, further this was around the time we posted our most successful reel.</p>
<h2>Facebook (<a href="https://edubuas-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/220367_buas_nl/EbrCf2cE77lElLpoA8VM8kUBN_ragKxx8diILRuJ_rtF5Q?e=UBP7mX" target="_blank">Analytics </a>)</h2>
    <p>We learned we can successfully reach accounts on Facebook to reach our reach objective. On Facebook we reached a total of 136 accounts, which means that we reached more than our reach objective, which was 100 followers. However, this was relatively late in the campaign, therefore we did not change this objective when we changed it for Instagram. However, we did start posting on Facebook a week late, so had we started posting on time, this would have been higher and we would have had to change the objective for Facebook too.</p>
    <p>We learned that it is more difficult to gain followers on Facebook than to gain followers on Instagram. This is due to the fact that we reached 241 followers on Instagram whereas we only gained 10 followers on Facebook. This difference between Instagram and Facebook can also be caused by the fact that our Facebook account was set as a business account, and that means you can’t follow any other accounts, unless they are business accounts, whereas with Instagram we were able to follow other accounts that were in our target audience and have come across our Instagram due to our following them and have then followed us. Since this could not be done on Facebook this was not an option to gain followers or reach.</p>
    <p>We learned that it is doable to gain engagement on Facebook and that we should be more confident when setting the response objective for this. We reached a total of 95 engagements of which most peaks were towards the end, however, the first peak was followed by more, which is due to the fact that in the first weeks of posting on Facebook we often posted more than once a day which meant that there were more posts to engage with.</p>

          <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
          <p>For our future planning, we would change our focus towards gaining engagement, as for the first four weeks our main focus was gaining reach. We did this mainly by posting daily and making sure that every post is made at a time that works for the relevant platform, which we succeeded in for Instagram but did not succeed in for Facebook.</p>

    <p>Therefore, we would look into scheduling posts so that they are automatically posted at the right time, as that way it does not have to be manually posted at the right time as it is possible that it will be forgotten as we have seen with the delayed foodie Friday's which were scheduled for the 29th of March but were posted on the 30st of March.</p>

    <p>We would now like to focus on engagement as we have noticed that we have had minimal engagement. If we shift our focus towards engagement we will start adding more call to action, as has been mentioned during our marketing classes, and we will also make sure to post reels and carrousel posts on the days that create more engagement which means that we will post our carrousel posts on Thursdays and our reels on Tuesdays (Coosto, 2024).</p>

    <p>However, just because we shift our focus to engagement, we still hope to gain reach because, as mentioned by Marta and Marta (2024), “Higher engagement signals to the Instagram algorithm that the content is valuable, increasing its potential reach.” This is why we would still plan to grow our reach in a following four weeks of a marketing campaign.</p>

    <p>This would lead us to have the following objectives:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Reach objective:</strong> We want to reach an amount of 500 users on Instagram as well as 150 users on Facebook, by the 30th of April 2024.</li>
        <li><strong>Affect:</strong> We want our followers/our target audience to feel inspired and excited by our social media posts and with that we also want them to feel connected to what our brand stands for by the 30th of April 2024.</li>
        <li><strong>Response:</strong> We want our target audience to respond by following our social media accounts and to interact (leave comments/like the posts) with our posts on Instagram and Facebook. We want to reach a minimum of 200 interactions on our Instagram and 75 interactions on Facebook by the 30th of April 2024.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For our future planning we would also not post every day anymore but would stick to three to five posts a week, as it is recommended to create at least three posts per week according to Macready (2023). These posts will all be different types of posts for example carousels, reels, and static posts on Instagram and of Facebook this will be a mix of text with photo’s or text with videos.</p>

    <p>Our post will stick to the same type of content as this best represents our brand.</p>

    <p>Our complete future planning can be found on the second page of the following document: <a href="https://edubuas-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/224996_buas_nl/EdkIAXwt3IFKnM5_yNbf26QB5PLYfTX7pFGG3M-6f2a_sA?e=ydAsVu" target="_blank">Social Media Planning.xlsx</a></p>

          <!-- End Marketing, start Management -->

          <h2 id="management" class="mt-5">Management</h2>

          <h4 id="management-1" class="mt-2">Lean Canvas</h4>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p class="fw-bold">Problem</p>
<ul>
            <li>For our last lean canvas, we narrowed down the problems we will solve in our finalized product. We do this to direct our focus on the main issues for now. We only stuck with the points almost all interviewees agreed with and understood what we were trying to solve. We created a product that allows us to solve different types of problems in one go. This way we can address as many problems as possible, but in an easy and smart way. While testing our product we also discovered people liked the fact that it is easy to use and not too broad, this way it is clear where to find what.  </li>
            <li></li>
</ul>
			 <p class="fw-bold">Interview Findings</p>
			 <li>We found that there are issues with finding trustworthy repair shops, this was mentioned several times in different interviews. It seems to be a significant problem within the community. The main issue being people do not know if the place they repair their campervan is actually trustworthy. You are fully dependent on the repair shop, so they sometimes take advantage of you in some situations. The quote from our interviews; “When my van has issues, which happens a lot, I first struggle with finding a place to repair it and then most of the times they let you pay so much money for the little things they did.” </li>
			 
			 <li>The next finding has to do with internet connection. Most of our campervan users are remote workers, or freelancers that do jobs on their computer. This way you need a decent internet connection to work. This seemed to be a large issue within the community. People found it hard to find places to work. Quotes from this; “When I have a freelancing job and I need to have internet connection, it is always difficult to find places to get internet from. Even if it says there is wifi, the connection can be really bad” </li>
			 
			 <li>Furthermore, we discovered how people feel about safety, this was also something we already mentioned in our first lean canvas. This seems to be an issue as well, mostly since people try to find free parking spots, which of course can get quite scary at night. Quotes from this: “I don’t have extra locks, but I do always lock my van at night. Since sometimes people keep approaching you to ask if they can see your van, as a girl alone this can be scary.” </li>
			 
			 <li>Then lastly, we found issues surrounding showers and toilets. Some people mentioned they didn’t have a shower or toilet in their van and just a bed. This seemed a problem, since it can be hard to find. Quotes we got from interviews are: “I usually go near to the beach to find free showers, but now that it is getting colder, I don’t want to shower in cold water, so I have to book a place to stay to be able to shower.”, and “I usually pee in nature, that comes with not having a toilet in your van”. </li>
			 
			 <li> For our solution-based interviews, we also used a survey, we did this since people mostly didn’t want to join in interviews, to already get some kind of overview. In the end we finished all the interviews, so we got some extra insights into the survey. Everything together mostly gave us, People loved the idea of reviews, since it helps everyone know for sure what to expect. Then people liked our platform since it offers everything in one go, you don’t need different apps, websites, etc. to find the information for your campervan adventures. </li>
			 <li>We got this information from many different quotes, the main ones being; “Every point should include a review option, they hold a lot of value”, “there is a lot of work to do while traveling with your van, you have to find safe places to sleep, find toilets and gestations. All of this will add many more hours to your travel.”  </li>
			 
			   <p class="fw-bold">The existing alternatives</p>
			 <li>For the alternatives we found google, Facebook and some apps who show toilets nearby. For the toilets nearby app, this is just one app for only toilets. You can also see the price it cost and reviews. It is a good and functional app. What we improve with this is showing more than just the toilets in one route. </li>
          <p class="fw-bold">Solution</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A route that provides it all, we come up with specific routes through all of Europe where the different spots needed are implemented. If you need to shower, you know there will be multiple stops on the route where you can do that.  
For safety we provide the possibility to leave reviews after you’ve passed the route stops. This way users can see what others find in these places. It gives a certain insurance about the places we provide. </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Customer segments</p>
          <ul>
            <li>We focus on the target audience from the age of 23 until 33. They are excited about traveling and DIY’ed their own campervan. We specifically focus on this audience, since after doing the research on social media and with our Interviews, this was the most accurate we could find. It is an easily reachable group that is always looking for new travel ways. </li>
            <li></li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Unique value proposition</p>
          <ul>
            <li>By this we mean that besides working on the solution for the problems we found, we also made sure to make it as safe and transparent as possible. We did this by implementing possibilities to provide reviews. In a website (app) like this, we will encourage people to leave reviews so they can help each other. That sets us apart. What is also important is that we are just one platform for all. Normally you need to look at one thing at a time. You have certain apps that will show you toilets nearby, but like this it is always 100% on the route we provide, and you can see everything you need, not just the toilet. Besides this, with the reviews your safety feeling will go up. Parking-places can be quite shady, but we provide them with the information that if it is a legit place, you can stay overnight, and the reviews show how safe a place is. </li>

          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Unfair advantage</p>
          <ul>
            <li>We find our platform different than others and not easily copied, since we have found many solutions to different types of problems. We fix them in one go, by providing only one product to get rid of all the issues. If you follow the routes we created on the platform, that will be the only thing to worry about. We even thought of safety issues by providing reviews on these stops on the routes. This way we don’t just take on the problems of finding certain points, but make sure that what we provide is of high quality and fulfills needs.   </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Channels</p>
          <p>We use the following channels to reach our customers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Our website</li>
            <li>Social media</li>
            <li>Travel communities</li>
            <li>Travel forums</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We choose social media, specifically Facebook and Instagram, as our primary channels because our target audience predominantly uses these platforms to communicate with each other and with brands. According to <a href="https://taplink.at/en/blog/fb_or_ig_is_instagram_better_than_facebook_and_why.html#:~:text=60%25%20of%20Instagram%20audience%20in,21%25%20are%2025–34" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Taplink</a>, 60% of Instagram users are aged 18-24, and 21% are aged 25–34.</p>
        <p>We also utilize travel communities as our audience frequently engages with these platforms to connect with fellow travelers, as evidenced by our interviews.</p>
        <p>Additionally, travel forums, such as TripAdvisor, serve as valuable communities where users share tips and tricks. We plan to engage with our target audience through these forums.</p>
          <p class="fw-bold">Key metrics</p>
          <ul>
            <li>To evaluate and trace the success of our platform we use statistics from social media. We now focus on Instagram, since Facebook turned out not to be a success. For our Instagram we grew within a month from 0 followers to 236. We put our goal at 100 followers, so we definitely have reached our goal. We had many people from the community get excited by our content. They started commenting on our posts and reaching out to us. </li>
            <li></li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Revenue streams</p>
         <p>For our lean canvas, we focus on three different revenue streams:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Ads on the website:</strong> We estimate approximately 300,000 views a month on our website. With this traffic, we can earn around €1,500 per month. Doubling the number of ads, we can potentially generate €3,000 per month. Source: <a href="https://www.playwire.com/blog/how-much-ad-revenue-can-a-website-make" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Playwire</a></li>
            <li><strong>Collaborations/Partnerships:</strong> We will collaborate with the location points we provide on our website as route points. Charging €150 per place per month, with 35 places in total, this revenue stream can generate €5,250. Calculation: €150 x 35 = €5250</li>
            <li><strong>Selling Data:</strong> We plan to sell data of some of our users to potential buyers. With an estimated 30,000 users, selling data at €0.15 cents per person can yield €4,500 per month. Source: <a href="https://www.invisibly.com/learn-blog/how-much-is-data-worth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Invisibly</a>. Calculation: 30,000 x €0.15 = €4500</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Total revenue is calculated as follows: €4,500 + €5,250 + €3,000 = €12,750</p>
    
          <p class="fw-bold">Cost structure</p>
          <p>Our main costs for the lean canvas are these four points:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Website Development:</strong> This is a direct and fixed cost. We expect the total cost to be €3,600 initially and then €50 per month. Dividing the €3,600 over 12 months, the monthly cost is €350. <em>Calculation: €3600 / 12 = €300 + €50 = €350</em>.

            <li><strong>Content Creation:</strong> This is an indirect and fixed cost. We expect around €70 per hour. Since we aim to be active, we need at least 30 minutes of work a day, 5 days a week, for the whole month, totaling €700. <em>Calculation: (30 x 5) / 60 = 2.5 hours a week. Then (2.5 x 4) x €70 = €700</em>. Source: <a href="https://planable.io/blog/social-media-management-pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Planable</a></li>
            <li><strong>Advertising Cost:</strong> This is an indirect and fixed cost. We aim to have at least 4 advertisements on travel platforms within a specific Travelport, costing approximately €20 per day. In total, the monthly cost will be €1,800. <em>Calculation: 4 x €20 x 30 = €2400</em>.

        </ol>
        <p>Total monthly cost: €3,450</p>
        <p>Cost per unit: €3,450 / €12,750 = €0.27</p>
			 <p class="fw-bold">Product</p>
			 <p>Our brand is VanFriends, as our product we have created a platform that holds all the information a van traveller asks for. We achieve this by sharing routes throughout Europe on our website, with all the information such as, where are parking place to stop and sleep, where to find gas stations, where to find clean sanitary and a nice warm shower, but also new roads to drive, new places to go and new sights to see. We also provide a place to leave reviews about all stops within the chosen route. It is a library of information specifically for our community of campervan travellers. With all their information organized in the same place, to spare time and effort searching in multiple places. With our platform, we aim to inspire people to share and obtain knowledge amongst themselves and other camper van friends. With quick and easy access through their phone, with the VanFriends website users can create their own adventures in nature and on the road without the worries of wasting more time on their phones searching for information instead of enjoying the nature that surrounds them.   </p>
          <h4 id="management-2" class="mt-2">Validation of Assumptions</h4>
<p>We made the decision for this specific product while keeping the interviews in mind. With what the audience had to say it was clear what they needed in order to make their travel experience more joyful and easy. Now on the market we see already different products that are similar or try something that is close to what we offer. The existing products such as: google, apps that provide toilets nearby, and different sites providing fun routes through Europe. The biggest difference is that we filter out the unnecessary information and only give them what they require. Furthermore, we do so while providing the safety they were also craving. The products now only offer one of the things we have or it is without the review option. </p>
